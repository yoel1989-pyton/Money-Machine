Why saving money makes you poorer? 

Most people think saving is smart. But here’s the catch: inflation erodes your cash value every year. 

For example, if you save $1,000, but inflation is 3%, that money loses $30 in purchasing power annually. 

The twist? Banks profit off your savings while they invest your money and earn higher returns. You’re left with stagnant cash. 

Don't be a victim of the savings trap! Invest wisely instead.
